# UI/UX Rules

## Icons
When adding icons to the project:
- ALWAYS use pickapicon-mcp to search for icons
- Use the search_icons tool before manually adding SVG icons
- Example prompt: "Search for a user icon using pickapicon"

## Animations
For animations and micro-interactions:
- ALWAYS check lottiefiles MCP first
- Use search_lottiefiles tool to find relevant animations
- Prefer animations that match our brand colors
- Example: "Find a loading animation using lottiefiles"

## Testing & Automation
For UI testing and browser automation:
- Use playwright MCP for automated browser testing
- Create tests for critical user flows
- Run tests before major UI changes

## General Style Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS with our custom theme
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Ensure all icons are consistent in style
